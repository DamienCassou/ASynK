	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>ASynK is a flexible Contacts synchronization program that works
	with a variety of Contacts software such as
	<span class="emph">Microsoft Outlook</span>, 
	<span class="emph">Google Contacts</span>, and 
	<span class="emph">Emacs BBDB</span>.

	<p>Some of the key features of ASynK are:

	</h3>

	<div class="announce_text">
	  We have just pushed release v0.3.0 out. Key changes are:
	  <ol>
	    <li>ASynK now ships with two default sync profiles called:
	    "defgcbb" and "defgcol", so there is out of the box support for
	    what should be the most common use cases - synching entire ~/.bbdb
	    or outlook contacts folder with google contacts. (Thanks to John
	    Wiegley for the idea)

	    <li>ASynK now uses ~/.asynk/ as the directory to store all state
	    information, logs and backups. Thus you can now have a single
	    installation of ASynK for all users in your system, and they will
	    each get .asynk/ directory in their home directories. If you have
	    any existing sync profiles and state, ASynK will notice this, and
	    migrate your current sync state to the ~/.asynk/ directory. You
	    can override the default directory name by passing the --user-dir
	    command argument to any invocation of ASynK. (Thanks to Ivan
	    Miljenovic for the idea)

	    <li>ASynK can now be invoked from anywhere; earlier you had to
	    ensure the present working directory was the root of the asynk
	    source directory. (Thanks to Ivan Miljenovic for the idea)
	    <p/>
	    <b>Important Note</b>: The above two changes together imply that if
	    you have existing sync state you want migrated, the first run after
	    your upgrade to v0.3.0 should be from inside ASynK directory for
	    us to be able to locate your config and state. Subsequent runs can
	    be done from anywhere and we will pick up your stuff from
	    ~/.asynk/

	    <li>Bug fix: Google Contacts' multiple group membership
	    information is now correctly synched back and forth to BBDB and
	    Outlook.

	    <li>Bug fix: The first email address in the BBDB email list is
	    treated as the primary address, and marked accordingly in Google
	    Contacts. Without this the order the email addresses in BBDB could
	    have appeared random, and changing from one sync to another.

	  </ol>

	</h3>

	<div class="announce_text">
	  We have just pushed release v0.2.2 out. Key changes are:
	  <ol>
	    <li>Now Item deletions are synched. i.e. if you have a sync
	    profile set up between Google folder and a Outlook folder, say,
	    and you delete a contact in Google, the next time you sync that
	    entry will be deleted from the corresponding Outlook folder as
	    well.<p/>

	    For this to work correctly, it is recommended that you do a full
	    sync of all your configured profiles once - note that a dry run is
	    not sufficient.

	    <li>Log files older than 7 days will be cleared every time asynk
	    is executed - except if it is a dry run. The duration can be
	    configured in config.json by changing the 'log_hold_period'
	    parameter.

	    <li>BBDB Backup files older than 7 days will cleared every time
	    asynk is executed - except if it is a dry run. The duration can be
	    configured in config.json by changing the 'backup_hold_period'
	    parameter.

	    <li>Misc bug fixes

	</h3>

	<div class="announce_text">
	  We have just pushed release v0.2.1 out. Key changes are:
	  <ol>
	    <li>BBDB file format 6 is now supported - with an important caveat
	    - Please refer to the <a
	     href='javascript:window.open("/doc/asynk/asynk_2.html#SEC8")'>
	    Dependencies section</a> of the documentation. BBDB file format 6
	    is used by BBDB versios 2.x bundled with XEmacs.

	    <li>Attempt is made to parse the BBDB file with multiple encodings
	    - for now utf-8 and latin-1. Additional encodings can be specified
	    in the config.json config file.

	    <li>Building documentaiton from source is now trivial, and
	    does not need autotools

	    <li>Instant Messaging fields are now synched across all sources

	    <li>Better error recovery in case of parse error with BBDB store

	    <li>Bugs fixes dealing with fax, notes, and company fields in
	    BBDB and Google Contacts
