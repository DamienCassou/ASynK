* Introduction

  Android sucks.

  Now that we have gotten that out of the system, let's get down to
  business. In general terms, there is a general shortage of good
  applications that allow two way synching of Outlook
  contacts/tasks/calendar to an android device. Google has strategic
  reasons, surely, for not making these tools available out of the
  box. But that doesn't make it any more palatable for us.

  This is an attempt to build some basic open source tools to plug
  this gap. The bsic approach is to sync your contacts and tasks with
  gmail, from which android can sync quite well.

* FAQ

** Why something new, why not try X?

   - There is no two way sync software available from Google for
     retail users. If you are lucky to have Google Apps for
     Enterprise, I believe there is a tool that might be
     adequate. It totally sucks that they don't just make it available
     to everyone. I paid $500 for my Nexus phone, damn it!

   - EX email addresses: If your outlook contacts database has email
     addresses in EX format, then most solutions out there will fail
     to do it for you. This includes even one time migration solutions
     such as exporting to CSV and importing into gmail, using Google's
     Migration tool for Google Apps, and 2 way sync solutions that
     otherwise have been reported to work well - like TouchDown for
     Outlook PST

   - Google's one way sync itself has major limitations such as
     terribly slow, lack of flexibility to upload to a specified
     Contacts Group, and till recently: broken EX email type. This
     makes it very difficult to even keep Outlook as master and copy
     to Gmail once in a while

   I mean, the situation is hopeless.

   There is a GPLed program written in C# called GoContactSync
   (http://sourceforge.net/projects/gocontactsync) that claims to do
   two way sync. But I have not given it a try as I do not know C# and
   had no interest in learning it now.

* Project Status

  The project is under active development and is to be treated as
  pre-alpha. It is only recommended for developers who don't mind
  pulling from github and running a few python scripts by hand on
  Windows.

  When it is 'ready to ship' it will be bundled into a neat self
  installing exe file, but that will come only when the basic
  functionality reaches beta quality.

* Installation Notes:

** Dependencies

   - Python 2.7
   - Pywin32 for Python 2.7
   - wxPython for Python 2.7

** How to run

   - The main file is Gout/start.py -- load it up in IDLE
   - You will have to edit the gmail credentials
