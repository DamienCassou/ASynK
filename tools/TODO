* TODO

** Two Way Sync Logic

*** Alogrithm to query and track updates to Google API

Figure out how updates to the Google contact list can be
recognized and synched.

*** Algorithm to query and track updates to Outlook API

** Support more contact fields to be uploaded

More contact fields need to get synched, including: all the phone
fields (more than 1 Home), Fax, anniversary, IM, etc.

The postal address information is not getting uploaded
properly. There is no problem in reading it from the Outlook
addressbook. There is some problem in uploading it with the right
schema

** Refactor to make contacts.py more object oriented

The code is a mess overall. Should really have MapiMsgStore, MapiFolder,
Message etc. type wrapper objects. It is not a pretty sight at the moment

** Distribution

We can make this an browser based application or an Outlook app. The
distribution might be smaller if we make it an Addin. However if we
make it a browser based application we might be able to reuse the code
for Karma.

*** Outlook Addin

**** Figure out how to add dialogs to the Outlook 

*** Browser App

**** Design

**** How to make it non-blocking

** Support more than one message store

We need to iterate and grab all the message store contents

There could be more than one message store in the default Outlook
Profile. Need to be able to look into all of them for contact
items.

* Done

** Track contacts that are uploaded

Completed: Tue Jul 12 18:43:20  2011

Store the ID of the newly created entry and store it in some user
defined field in Outlook.
