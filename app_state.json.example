// This file is for illustrative purposes only. Edits to this file

// The application uses a configuration file called app_state.json to
// keep a track of sync state and other configuration values. In the
// distribution app_state.json will have the same contents as this
// file. However it is updated by the first run and replaced with a
// hard-to-read plain and simple json without these comments and
// updated to reflect any settings you might have chosen during your
// run. 

// While modifying the app_state.json is allowed,ensure the
// application is not running at the time. But remember that the user
// should not *have* to edit the app_state.json file directly.
