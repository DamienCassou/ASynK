   Started work on recovering from parsing errors during making lists... -
   https://github.com/skarra/ASynK/issues/37

   This has many parts:

   a) While building the lists we need to track a new category of contacts -
      those that had an error. 

   b) Then treat these errors differently.

   c) Identify there have been errors, and treat them differently.
