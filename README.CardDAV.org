This file is a README for the 'carddav' branch. This file will be deleted after this branch is merged with master.

The carddav branch is an experimental branch for a new datastore backend for CardDAV servers. The idea is with this one can sync BBDB and MS Outlook contacts to a CardDAV server.

   Discovered Apple's pretty decent caldavclientibrary, which has webdav/caldav/carddav wrappers. It's going to make it easier to deal with the server, and we will at least work with Apple's Calendar server. Hooked up this guy with a simple test script and pimdb_cd.py is on its way! Humble beginning.
