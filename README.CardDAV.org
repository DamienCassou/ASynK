This file is a README for the 'carddav' branch - an experimental branch for a
new datastore backend for CardDAV servers. The idea is with this one can sync
BBDB and MS Outlook contacts to a CardDAV server.

* Installation & Usage Notes for CardDAV

  Keep in mind this is an experimental feature. Unlike Google Contacts,
  CardDAV servers do not generally support a roll back feature. This means any
  ASynK bugs could potentially lead to loss of information for you. So please
  take your own precautions before you deploy this on your live data.

** Steps

   $ ./asynk.py --op=create-profile --name testbbcd --user-dir=~/.asynk.carddav --db bb cd --folder default default --store <opath-to-bbdb-file> 'https:localhost:8443'
   $ ./asynk.py --op=sync --user-dir=~/.asynk.carddav --name testbbcd --dry-run

   Ensure you are able to login to your account properly.

   $ ./asynk.py --op=sync --user-dir=~/.asynk.carddav --name testbbcd

** Notes

   1. Create a test set up for your evaluation. This should include a test
      list of your contacts in a separate BBDB datastore, and a test carddav
      server account. I also strongly encourage you use the --user-dir option
      while invoking asynk, so that your 'production' state.json is not messed
      with.

   2. The config.json format has changed a bit to accomodate the
      requirements. So you should copy the config.json from the asynk source
      directory manually to your asynk user dir. This step will be automated
      at a later time before official release.

   3. You will be prompted for your carddav server login and password from
      STDIN. You can avoid having to type this repeatedly by piping your
      password to asynk or having the following entry in your ~/.netrc

      machine cd_testbbcd
      login <<login>>
      password <<password>>

      Note that the 'testbbcd' is the name of the test profile you created.

   4. If you want to sync to a specific folder on the server you can do that
      at the time of profile creation, like in this example: 

      $ ./asynk.py --op=create-profile --name testbbcd --user-dir=~/.asynk.carddav --db bb cd --folder default '/addressbooks/__uids__/skarrag/addressbook' --store <opath-to-bbdb-file> 'localhost:8008'

   5. The following fields are synched to/from the carddav contacts:

      First name
      Last name
      Middle name
      Formatted name
      Suffix, Prefix
      Gender
      Email addresses
      Phone numbers
      Title
      Department
      Company name
      Notes

      More will be supported over time.

* TODOs

** Post initial announcement

    - (Optional) Table of supported fields and interop matrix
   - Test against different servers and maintain supported status
   - Recognize server return format and assert vCard 3.0
   - Support additional vCard property tag extensions in common use. 

*** Tag support
 
    - IM
    - WWW
    - Postal Addresses
    - Custom fields

* Developer's Log

** Thu Apr 18 18:16:40 IST 2013

   All sync related stuff is now sorted. All changes on both client and server
   get picked up and "the needful" is done! Hurrah.

   The next big item to crack is to do a thorough map of the fields and vCard
   attributes. This is particularly important given the terrible situation
   with respect to interop and lack of standardization.

   In the spirit of "be flexible in what you accept, be conservative in what
   you put out"... as applicable to our situation, I think the best approach
   is to identify the most popular extended attributes for various situations,
   and to (a) look for them to input data and (b) to write redundant
   attribtues for different clients so the generated vCard files will be
   readable by multiple clients.

** Tue Apr 16 18:40:45 IST 2013

   Lots of progress. Now the batch_create and batch_update methods are
   implemented. So a BBDB, say, contacts that are not synched, or are synched
   and updated, are properly identified and synched to server - full etag
   support and all that good stuff.

   CardDAV server side dedits are not getting properly recognized. This and
   other stuff needs to be figured out next. Exciting.

** Mon Apr 15 18:22:28 IST 2013

   Some pretty nice progress. Now we can create a new profile containing a
   'cd' store, and do a sync dry run. The status are properly fetched and
   displayed.

** Wed Apr 10 07:22:11 IST 2013

   Got the multiget request to work. Now on to figuring out the rest of the stuff.

** Sat Apr 06 22:36:39 IST 2013

   Started to explore how to start querying the server, etc. Turns out we have
   a few major problems:
   
   a) webdav/carddav do not have a concept of multiput. So when we are putting
      updates to the server, we have to do one URI at a time. How lame!

   b) The apple tool and client library we have does not really implement the
      carddav multiget and other options. We have some way to go to figure out
      how to implement some of those things first before using them in our
      code.

** Fri Apr 05 15:53:17 IST 2013

   Learnt that UID is required; the URI has nothing to do with the UID (or any
   other field for that matter). Just needs to be unique. The RFC talks about
   this topic.

   Implemented email address support; and spent a lot of time understaning how
   params are encoded by vobject etc.

   Also learnt that the overall field mapping interop situation is a
   mess. vCard 3.0 is the most widely implemented system; and yet there are so
   many basic fields that are not defined. Respect for MS has gone up another
   notch after I found their [MS-OXVCARD.pdf] specification laying out in
   details the field mappings from outlook contact from/to vCard.

   The mapping strategy is to see what Google Contact, Apple Addressbook, and
   MS Outlook mapings look like and support them as applicable. Reading is
   fine, but writing may be a challenge.

   Able to (a) fetch a vcf file from server (b) parse and extract a few fields
   (like name, suffix etc.) from it, and (c) construct a contact object

   Also able to construct a simple CDContact objet, and then push it to the
   sever.

   That is some pretty good progress... but many things about UID management
   are not clear. For sake of convenience added a get_uid/set_uid pair for
   contact_cd.py, but this is not the right way to go. Need to understand how
   the vCard UID field is used And also figure out how it is to be used in
   synching.

** Thu Apr 04 13:27:53 IST 2013

   Able to read server side addressbook folders, fetch their contents, and
   construct the pimdb/folder/contact objects. Next step is to be able to
   parse the vCard files and construct Contacts objects from fetched contents.

** Tue Apr 02 19:39:42 IST 2013

   Discovered Apple's pretty decent caldavclientlibrary, which has
   webdav/caldav/carddav wrappers. It's going to make it easier to deal with
   the server, and we will at least work with Apple's Calendar server. Hooked
   up this guy with a simple test script and pimdb_cd.py is on its way! Humble
   beginning.
